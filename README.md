# trip-points: AngularJS experiment for calculating a trip path

Basically, enter a bunch of coordinates that you wish to visit and the app
will calculate the optimal path to visit those places using Nearest Neighbour
algorithm. As such, all the limitations that apply to NN apply here.

It has been built on top of Angular seed repo. It might have been an overkill
but turned out well.
